            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, my name is Adrian! As a Full Stack Developer with a
              healthcare background, I bring a unique perspective to the tech
              world. A proud graduate of the Triple Ten Coding Bootcamp, I've
              honed and continue to refine my skills in the MERN stack (MongoDB,
              Express.js, React, Node.js), staying at the forefront of
              technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey from healthcare to technology is driven by a passion
              for lifelong learning and growth. I am committed to creating
              intuitive user experiences and relish opportunities to integrate
              my healthcare insights with modern technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based in the California Central Valley, I'm actively seeking both
              in-person and or remote roles that challenge me and have the
              potential for positive impact. I thrive on projects that meld
              technical skill with deep empathy.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're in search of a developer who is eager to contribute to
              transformative projects, let's connect and explore the
              possibilities together!
            </p>
